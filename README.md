## Introduction

This baseline method is developed and refined based on <a href="https://github.com/xiaojunxu/SQLNet">code</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04436">SQLNet</a>, which is a baseline model in <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL">WikiSQL</a>.

The model decouples the task of generating a whole SQL into several sub-tasks, including select-number, select-column, select-aggregation, condition-number, condition-column and so on.
